Let's walk through the code step-by-step and explain both the code itself and the theoretical concepts behind the symbol table used in the code:

### Code Explanation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cctype>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;
```
- **Includes**: The program includes necessary libraries for input/output operations (`iostream`), character handling (`cctype`), dynamic memory allocation (`cstdlib`), and string manipulation (`cstring`).

```cpp
int main() {
    int i = 0, x = 0, n;
    void *p, *add[5];
    char b[50], d[15], c;
```
- **Variable Declarations**:
  - `i` and `x` are counters.
  - `n` stores the length of the input expression.
  - `p` is a generic pointer used for dynamic memory allocation.
  - `add` is an array of pointers to store addresses of allocated memory.
  - `b` is a character array to store the input expression.
  - `d` is a character array to store symbols (identifiers and operators) from the input expression.
  - `c` is a character variable for reading each character from the input.

```cpp
    cout << "Expression terminated by $:";
    while ((c = getchar()) != '$') {
        b[i] = c;
        i++;
    }
    n = i - 1;
```
- **Input Handling**:
  - Prompts the user to enter an expression terminated by `$`.
  - Reads characters one by one using `getchar()` until `$` is encountered.
  - Stores each character in array `b`.
  - `n` is set to the index of the last character in the input expression (excluding `$`).

```cpp
    cout << "Given Expression:";
    for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        cout << b[i];
    }
```
- **Output Expression**:
  - Prints the stored expression.

```cpp
    cout << "\nSymbol Table\n";
    cout << "Symbol \t addr \t size \t type\n";
```
- **Symbol Table Header**:
  - Prints the header for the symbol table, indicating columns for symbol, address, size, and type.

```cpp
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
        c = b[j];
        if (isalpha(c)) {
            int size = sizeof(char); // Size of character is 1 byte
            p = malloc(size);
            add[x] = p;
            d[x] = c;
            cout << c << " \t " << p << " \t " << size << " \t identifier\n";
            x++;
        } else if (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '=') {
            int size = sizeof(char); // Size of character is 1 byte
            p = malloc(size);
            add[x] = p;
            d[x] = c;
            cout << c << " \t " << p << " \t " << size << " \t operator\n";
            x++;
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
- **Symbol Table Creation**:
  - Iterates through each character in the input expression.
  - **Identifiers**:
    - If the character is an alphabet letter (checked using `isalpha`), it is treated as an identifier.
    - Allocates memory for the character and stores the address in `add`.
    - Prints the character, its address, size (1 byte), and type ("identifier").
  - **Operators**:
    - If the character is one of `+`, `-`, `*`, `=`, it is treated as an operator.
    - Allocates memory for the character and stores the address in `add`.
    - Prints the character, its address, size (1 byte), and type ("operator").
  - **Increment Counter**:
    - `x` is incremented each time an identifier or operator is added to the symbol table.

### Theoretical Concept: Symbol Table

A **symbol table** is a data structure used in compilers and interpreters to keep track of identifiers (such as variable names, function names) and their associated attributes (like type, scope, memory location). It serves several purposes:
- **Semantic Checking**: Ensures that operations are semantically correct.
- **Memory Management**: Keeps track of memory locations allocated for variables.
- **Code Generation**: Helps in generating the correct machine code.

In this code:
- The symbol table is represented using arrays `d` for symbols and `add` for their corresponding addresses.
- The `malloc` function dynamically allocates memory for each symbol, and the pointer `p` is used to store these addresses.
- The program categorizes symbols into identifiers and operators, which is a simplified example of what a real compiler does.

Overall, the symbol table helps the program to maintain a structured record of various elements in the input expression, facilitating further processing and ensuring correct operations.
